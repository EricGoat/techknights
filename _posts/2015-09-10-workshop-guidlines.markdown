At Knight Hacks, we hold workshops to provide everyone with extracirricular opportunities to learn skills used in the industry. We also strive to build a healthy hacker culture here at UCF.

We greatly appreciate and encourage all help from everyone in running these workshops. If you would like to run a workshop, please get in touch with us at team@knighthacks.org, or through Slack.

This being said, please adhere to the following guidelines when preparing and giving workshops:

* Try to keep things simple and to the point; don't go too deep. Learn the what before the why
 * There's often a lot of material to cover and not a lot of time.
* Make everything accessible from a beginner level
 * We want to make sure the workshops are accessible to everyone, regardless of prior knowledge. We do not want the workshop content to be overbearing or intimidating
* Workshop style, not lecture style. People should be able to follow along, step by step
* Stop peroidically and ask if there are questions
* Speak loudly and go slow
* Treat all people equally
 * Absolutely no sexism, racism, religious discrimination, or anything of the sort will be tolerated. In addition, while it's sometimes funny to make fun of text editors and operating systems, try to avoid discriminating against different computer ideologies
* Treat everyone with respect
* Do not touch anyone else's keyboard
 * Touching keyboards is demoralizing and makes it harder for people to learn how to solve their problems. Instead, try to explain step-by-step what to type or click on to overcome an obstacle.
